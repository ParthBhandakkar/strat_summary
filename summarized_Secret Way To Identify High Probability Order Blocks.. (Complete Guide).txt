This video explains how to identify "auto blocks" in trading,  which are described as consecutive candles indicating a market structure shift after sweeping liquidity at a key level.  The key points are:

**Identifying Valid Auto Blocks:**

* **Rule 1: Key Level:** The auto block must form at a key level (higher timeframe support/resistance, gaps, liquidity pools, etc.).  Price action at this level is crucial.

* **Rule 2: Liquidity Sweep & Market Structure Shift:** The auto block must sweep some liquidity, followed by a clear market structure shift (e.g., higher high/lower low for bullish, lower high/lower low for bearish). The auto block itself consists of the consecutive candles leading to the shift, not just the final candle.

* **Rule 3:  "Kill Zones" (High Trading Volume Periods):** Auto blocks forming during high-volume periods (like London or New York sessions) are considered more powerful.  The market structure shift should ideally also occur during these times.

**Auto Block Identification Details:**

* **Consecutive Candles:**  The auto block comprises consecutive candles (bearish for long entries, bullish for short entries) that collectively sweep liquidity.  Even a single candle can qualify if it sweeps liquidity and triggers a market structure shift.
* **Wicks Ignored:** Only the candle bodies (open and close prices) are considered, not the wicks.
* **Alternative Method (Higher Risk/Reward):** Instead of using all consecutive candles, traders can use only the last candle of the move. This increases the risk/reward ratio but may lead to missed opportunities.
* **Entry & Stop Placement:** Entries are taken at the close of the auto block (body), with stops placed below (long) or above (short) the relevant swing low/high.

**Examples provided illustrate these rules using various timeframes (daily, hourly, 30-minute, 4-hour) and chart patterns (fare valley gaps, liquidity pools).**  The examples show how to identify the auto block and determine entry and stop-loss points.
