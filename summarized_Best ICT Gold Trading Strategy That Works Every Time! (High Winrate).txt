This video details a gold trading strategy with a high win rate, focusing on trading only once per day at a specific time.

**The Strategy:**

1. **Time Zone:** Set your trading platform to New York time.
2. **Pre-Market (Before 8 PM NY Time):** Identify the most recent high and low on the 15-minute chart.
3. **Market Entry (After 8 PM NY Time):** Wait for the price to break either the identified high or low.
4. **Shift to 1-Minute Chart:** Once the 15-minute high or low is broken, switch to the 1-minute chart.
5. **Identify Market Structure Shift with Displacement:** Look for a market structure shift (a clear change in trend) with a "fair value gap" (a noticeable price gap).  The speaker prefers entries based on "auto blocks" (consecutive bullish or bearish candles) rather than solely relying on the fair value gap.
6. **Entry:** Take your entry before 10 PM NY Time, either on the close of a candle forming the market structure shift or from an auto block.
7. **Stop Loss:** Place your stop loss below the low (or above the high, if shorting) accounting for spreads.
8. **Take Profit:** Aim for a 1:2 risk-reward ratio (e.g., take profit at double your stop loss).  The speaker suggests closing 80-85% of the position at 1:2 and letting the rest ride for potential larger gains, but always going break even at a 1:1 ratio.
9. **Trailing Stop:** After reaching break-even, trail your stop loss above subsequent highs (or below subsequent lows) to lock in profits.

**Key Considerations:**

* The strategy works best on Gold (XAUUSD), but can sometimes be applied to AUDJPY and CADJPY.
* Only one trade per day is recommended.
* The strategy is described as mechanical, requiring minimal daily monitoring.
* Examples are provided in the video to illustrate the strategy.


The strategy emphasizes careful identification of market structure shifts and uses risk management techniques (stop loss, trailing stop, partial profit taking) to maximize profitability while minimizing risk.
