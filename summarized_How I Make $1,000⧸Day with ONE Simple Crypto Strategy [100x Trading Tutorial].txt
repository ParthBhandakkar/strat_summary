This video describes a crypto trading strategy aiming for $1000/day profits.  The core strategy involves:

**1. Timeframe:** Trading above the 15-minute timeframe is crucial to avoid account blow-ups.

**2. Identifying Ranges:** The strategy focuses on range-bound markets.  A range high is easily identified; a range low is identified by a "market structure shift" â€“ a series of lower lows and lower highs culminating in a break of a previous lower high.

**3. Entry Point:**  Once a range high and low are established, wait for price to break the range high (or low). Then, look for a market structure shift in the opposite direction, followed by a price close back *within* the original range.  Enter the trade based on consecutive bullish (or bearish) candles ("auto block") in the direction of the range break.

**4. Risk Management & Take Profit:** Use Fibonacci retracement levels (from range low to range high) to determine take profit levels.

*   **0.5 level:** Take 25% profit and adjust stop loss to break even.
*   **0.79 level:** Take another 25% profit.  Consider trailing stop loss above the 0.5 level high or keeping it at break even.
*   **1.0 level:** Final take profit, or trail stop loss further if momentum continues.

**5. Invalidation:** If, *before* entering a trade, price breaks both the range high and low, the setup is invalid.  However, if price hits the 0.5 or 0.79 levels *after* entry, the risk management steps should still be followed.

The video emphasizes the strategy's mechanical nature and provides multiple live trade examples to illustrate the process.  It also mentions an upcoming crypto signal service.
