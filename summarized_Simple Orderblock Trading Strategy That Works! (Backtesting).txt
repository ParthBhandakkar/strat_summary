Faz backtests his "autoflow SMC trading strategy" on USD/CAD.  The strategy involves:

* **Identifying the autoflow (overall trend):**  He determines if the overall trend is bullish or bearish based on the 4-hour chart.  In this backtest, it started bullish but shifted bearish later.
* **Marking Point of Interest (POI) areas (auto blocks):** These are areas of support or resistance identified on the 4-hour chart.
* **Looking for market structure shifts on lower timeframes (15-minute):** Entries are taken when a market structure shift occurs *during London session kill hours (2:00-4:00 PM GMT)*.
* **Entry:** Longs are taken when a structure shift happens within a POI area during London kill hours. Shorts are taken in similar fashion during a bearish autoflow.
* **Stop Loss:** Typically 28 pips, placed below the low of the entry candle.
* **Take Profit:** 1:2 risk/reward ratio (double the stop loss).

The backtest spanned from September 26th to November 23rd.
