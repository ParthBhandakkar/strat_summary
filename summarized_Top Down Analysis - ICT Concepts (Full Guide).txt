This video describes a top-down trading strategy using external and internal liquidity.  The trader determines a daily or weekly bias, then uses an economic calendar to identify high/medium impact news days for increased volatility.  Trading occurs *after* news events.

**Bias Determination:**

* **Daily Bias:** Traded on lower timeframes.  Confirmation involves identifying external liquidity on the daily chart, then looking for a market structure shift on the 1-hour chart, followed by a 5-minute confirmation.
* **Weekly Bias:** Traded on higher timeframes. Confirmation involves identifying external liquidity on the weekly chart, then looking for a market structure shift on the 4-hour chart, followed by a 15-minute confirmation.

**Trading Process:**

1. **Identify Bias:** Using daily or weekly timeframe, determine market bias based on external and internal liquidity.
2. **Economic Calendar:** Use to find high/medium impact news days, trading *after* the news event.  Look for price action to reach predetermined price discovery ranges (PDRA) â€“  buy-side liquidity purges in bearish biases, sell-side purges in bullish biases.
3. **Time Frame Alignment:** Confirm bias across multiple timeframes (daily/1-hour/5-minute for daily bias, weekly/4-hour/15-minute for weekly bias). Look for market structure shifts to confirm directional moves.
4. **Entry:**  Entries are taken after confirmation across multiple timeframes, often at a PDRA (e.g., fray valley gap, auto block). Optional entry patterns include ABC patterns and inducement/liquidity level pullbacks.
5. **Risk Management:**  Break-even at a 1:1 risk-reward ratio.  Target 1:2 or 1:3 risk-reward, potentially adjusting to 1.5:1 or 2:1 for very high-confidence setups.

The video includes several examples illustrating the strategy's application across different timeframes and news events.  The trader also promotes their course and Discord server offering signals and further education.
