This video describes two methods for identifying "real liquidity sweeps" in forex trading:

**Method 1: Three-Candle Pattern**

*   This method involves identifying a liquidity level (high or low on the chart).
*   A three-candle pattern forms:
    *   The first candle closes.
    *   The second candle sweeps the liquidity level (touches and reverses).  It should be the highest (for a buy) or lowest (for a sell) candle of the three.
    *   The third candle breaks the high of the second candle (for a buy) or the low of the second candle (for a sell).  Crucially, the first and third candles should not break the low (buy) or high (sell) of the second candle.
*   Entry:  Take entry on a retest of the high (buy) or low (sell) of the second candle, or look for value gaps on a smaller timeframe (e.g., 1-minute chart if the pattern is on a 15-minute chart).  Stop loss above the high (buy) or below the low (sell) of the second candle.

**Method 2: Two-Candle Pattern**

*   Identify a liquidity level.
*   The first candle sweeps the liquidity level (it doesn't need a full body; a wick is sufficient).
*   The second candle does *not* break the low (buy) or high (sell) of the first candle.
*   Entry: Drop down to a smaller timeframe and look for a market structure shift to confirm the trade.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timeframes:**  For pattern formation and entry, the recommended minimum timeframe is 15 minutes.  Smaller timeframes can be used for entry confirmation.
*   **Trading Hours ("Kills"):**  Liquidity sweeps are most reliable during specific trading hours:  London session (3 AM to 6 AM New York time) and New York session (8:30 AM to 11:15 AM New York time).  Trades outside these hours are less reliable.
*   **Context:**  Use these methods in conjunction with other analyses (trend, bias, etc.). Don't rely solely on liquidity sweeps.
*   Method 1 is considered more powerful than Method 2.


The video includes examples of both methods applied to charts, but the examples are described verbally rather than visually, making a complete understanding difficult without access to the video itself.
