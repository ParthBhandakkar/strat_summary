This upgraded "Silver Bullet" trading strategy aims for a higher win rate than its predecessor (40-45%).  It focuses on identifying intraday bias using external range liquidity (ERL) and internal range liquidity (IRL) on the 15-minute timeframe before the trading window.

**London Session Silver Bullet (3 AM - 4 AM):**

*   Identify ERL breakout on the 15-minute chart before 3 AM.
*   Switch to the 1-minute chart and look for a fair value gap (FVG) and market structure shift after the ERL breakout.
*   Entry before 4 AM, targeting a 1:1 or 1:2 risk-reward ratio.
*   Look for SMT (Stochastic Momentum Index) divergences for increased probability.

**New York Session Silver Bullet (10 AM - 11 AM):**

*   Similar process as London session, but before/after 10 AM.
*   Identify the dealing range (high and low defined by liquidity sweeps).
*   FVG entry within the dealing range, targeting 1:1, 1:2, or 1:3 risk-reward ratio (1:2 recommended).

**Key Concepts:**

*   **External Range Liquidity (ERL):** Highs and lows on the chart.
*   **Internal Range Liquidity (IRL):** Fair value gaps.
*   **Dealing Range:** High and low defined by liquidity sweeps on the 15-minute chart.  FVGs within this range are prioritized.
*   **Market Structure Shift:** A reversal in price action on the 1-minute chart.
*   **SMT Divergence:** Discrepancy between price action and the SMT indicator, indicating potential reversal.  Used as a confirmation signal.
*   **Risk-Reward Ratio:**  The strategy emphasizes a 1:2 risk-reward ratio (minimum 1:1).

**Correlating Pairs:**

*   USD pairs: GBPUSD for EURUSD, NZDUSD for AUDUSD.
*   JPY pairs: GBPJPY for EURJPY.
*   Indices: US30 and S&P 500 for NAS100.
