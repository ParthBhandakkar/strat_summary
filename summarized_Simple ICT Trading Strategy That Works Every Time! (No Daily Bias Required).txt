This video describes a trading strategy that combines the ABC pattern with points of interest (POIs) like order blocks (OB), fair value gaps (FVG), and supply zones to increase win rates.

**The Core Strategy:**

1. **Identify a Break of Structure:** Locate a clear break in market structure (higher high/lower low).
2. **Mark POIs:** Identify potential POIs (OB, FVG, supply zones) near the break of structure.
3. **Wait for ABC Formation:**  Look for an ABC pattern near the identified POI.  The "C" leg of the ABC should ideally reach the POI without piercing through it.
4. **Market Structure Shift:** Wait for a market structure shift (a change in the connector or a break of structure) *below the range* of the ABC pattern (for short trades) or *above the range* (for long trades).
5. **Entry:** Enter the trade from the extreme of the POI (FVG, OB) after the structure shift.
6. **Take Profit:** Target a pre-determined take profit level.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Entry Timing:**  Enter trades during periods of low liquidity ("kill zones").
* **Invalid Structures:** If the price moves below (short) or above (long) the range of the ABC pattern before creating a structure, the setup is invalid.


The video provides multiple examples illustrating the strategy's application in various market conditions and emphasizes the precision and effectiveness of this combined approach.  The presenter strongly advocates backtesting this strategy.  A course offering additional trading strategies is also promoted.
