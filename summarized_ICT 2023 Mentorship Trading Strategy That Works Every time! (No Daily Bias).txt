This video describes an ICT-based trading strategy claiming profitability within 90 days.  The core rules are:

**Timing and Chart Setup:**

* **9:50 AM New York Time:** Open charts (5-minute timeframe). Identify the recent high and low of the price action.  If unclear, wait until 9:55 AM.  Ignore previous price action.
* **Entry Time:** Between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM New York Time.  Do not enter trades after 10:50 AM.

**Trade Execution:**

1. **Liquidity Sweep:** After marking the high and low, look for price to break above the high (long) or below the low (short) â€“ a liquidity sweep.
2. **Timeframe Change:** Switch to a 1-minute timeframe.
3. **Market Structure Shift:** Look for a clear shift in market structure after the liquidity sweep.
4. **Fair Value Gap (FVG):** Identify a fair value gap. Enter a trade at the FVG.  If no FVG is apparent, consider entry near other support/resistance levels.
5. **Stop Loss:** Place the stop-loss order just above (long) or below (short) the recent high or low.
6. **Take Profit:** Target the initial liquidity level.  Other options include targeting subsequent FVGs or using a 1:2 risk/reward ratio.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Instruments:** The strategy is primarily recommended for indices (like NASDAQ 100 and S&P 500), although it may work with USD pairs.
* **Backtesting:**  The presenter strongly encourages backtesting the strategy before live trading.
* **Risk/Reward:** While aiming for 1:5 risk/reward is ideal, trades may yield varying results (sometimes as low as 1:2).
* **Win Rate:**  The presenter claims a 65% win rate based on backtesting.

The video includes multiple examples illustrating the strategy's application, emphasizing a mechanical approach, and minimizing reliance on daily bias.  However, it also notes that trade management is not explicitly defined, and the presenter encourages joining a community for additional learning and advanced strategies.
