This video describes a Forex trading strategy the presenter calls "ATM," claiming it consistently generates profits.  The strategy focuses on the GBPUSD, USDGBP, and AUDUSD pairs, using a New York time frame.

**Core Strategy:**

1. **Identify Midnight Open (12 AM NY Time) and 8:30 AM NY Time opens.**
2. **Before 8:30 AM NY Time:** Identify the daily high and low.  The presenter recommends switching to a 1-minute timeframe at 8:29 AM to precisely mark these levels.
3. **After 8:30 AM NY Time:** Look for a "sweep" of the daily high or low (price moves beyond and then retraces from it).
4. **Entry:** Take your entry on the first market structure shift *after* the sweep, ideally with a fair value gap preceding the shift.
5. **Stop Loss:** Place your stop loss above (for long) or below (for short) the high/low of the market structure shift.
6. **Target:** Aim for a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2. Identify the closest resistance/support level.
7. **Timing:** Trade only between 8:30 AM and 11:30 AM NY Time, closing all positions before 12 PM.  The presenter suggests considering whether the price is above or below the midnight open to potentially bias long or short entries.

The presenter emphasizes the importance of identifying a market structure shift with a preceding fair value gap, stating these elements alongside the sweep confirm a high-probability trade setup.  Two examples of trades using this strategy are provided in the text.  The presenter also mentions the concept of "daily bias" as a potential enhancement, but states it is not required for the strategy to be profitable.  A paid course offering further strategies and a trading community is promoted.
