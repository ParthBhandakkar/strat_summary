This trading strategy, viewed over 20k times, identifies swing highs and lows on a 15-minute timeframe during the London and New York sessions.  The core concept is fractal:  it applies across timeframes.

**Daily Timeframe (explained but less emphasized):**

* Identify swing highs/lows.
* Mark the high (swing low) or low (swing high) of the *third* candle after the swing.
* On the next day's opening, look for a liquidity sweep on the 5-minute chart and enter, targeting the marked level.

**15-Minute Timeframe (primary focus):**

* Identify swing highs/lows.
* Mark the high (swing low) or low (swing high) of the *third* candle.
* On the next 15-minute candle's open, mark the opening price.
* Switch to the 1-minute timeframe.
* Look for a liquidity sweep *below* the opening price (for swing lows) or *above* (for swing highs).
* Enter on a retest of an inverse frivolous gap or a market structure shift, targeting the marked high/low.  There's an >80% chance the third candle's high/low will be broken.

**Key elements:**

* **Liquidity sweeps:**  Essential for entry signals on the 1-minute chart.
* **Inverse frivolous gaps/Market structure shifts:** Confirmation signals on the 1-minute chart for entry.
* **High probability setups:** Occur more often when swing points follow key liquidity takedowns or form in higher timeframe patterns.  However, the strategy works regardless.
* **Risk management:** The trader suggests taking only 1-2 setups per day to manage psychology.  Stop-loss placement is mentioned but specifics aren't detailed.  Risk/Reward ratios of 2.3:1 and 2.7:1 are shown in examples.
