This video explains how to identify daily bias using five rules:

**1. Identify Recent Liquidity Sweep:** Locate a recent significant price movement that took out existing orders (stop-loss orders).

**2. Identify Resting Liquidity in Opposite Direction:** Identify potential support or resistance levels (liquidity) in the opposite direction of the liquidity sweep.  Significant highs, lows, and equal highs/lows are considered liquidity levels.

**3. Mark Out Fair Value Gaps and Auto Blocks Near Current Price:**  Find areas where the price has "skipped" over (fair value gaps) and areas where the price has shown strong rejection (auto blocks).

**4. Identify Premium and Discount Zones:** Using a Fibonacci retracement tool from a recent swing low to swing high, identify the 0.5 level (equilibrium â€“ EQ).  Below the EQ is the discount zone, above is the premium zone.

**5. Overall Market Structure (Optional):** Consider the broader market trend, but this is less crucial than the other four rules.

**Trading Strategy:**

* **Discount Zone (below EQ):** Look for long positions.
* **Premium Zone (above EQ):** Look for short positions.

The speaker emphasizes that this method doesn't guarantee 100% accuracy (expect 40-50% win rate), and traders may miss profitable opportunities.  The rules help increase win rate by focusing on probabilities.  Once price reaches a Fair Value Gap, the speaker suggests using additional trading patterns (taught elsewhere) to enter trades.
