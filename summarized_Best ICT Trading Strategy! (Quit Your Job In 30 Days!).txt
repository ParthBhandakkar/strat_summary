This YouTube video presents a five-rule trading strategy claimed to achieve profitability.  The strategy uses two timeframes (e.g., 4-hour and 1-minute).

**Five Rules:**

1. **Identify Higher Time Frame Auto Flow (Trend):** Determine the overall trend direction on the higher timeframe.

2. **Mark Out Points of Interest (POIs):** Identify POIs, preferably auto blocks (areas of prior price rejection), on the higher timeframe.

3. **Wait for Price to Return to POI with a Specific Pattern:** Price must return to the POI in a "turtle soup" pattern (higher high, higher low, higher high) or an ABC pattern.

4. **Wait for Market Structure Shift on Lower Time Frame:** Observe the lower timeframe for a market structure shift.  High probability shifts involve a break of structure below the "A" leg high with a "fairly gap" (a gap created *before* a market structure shift, not an "inefficiency gap"). Low probability shifts are simply breaks of structure upon price returning to the POI.

5. **Market Structure Shift Must Occur During "Kill Zone R's":**  All market structure shifts and entries must happen within these unspecified time periods ("Kill Zone R's").  The presenter emphasizes the importance of timing for algorithmic trading success.

**Additional Information:**

* **Entry:** Entries are taken after a market structure shift and "fairly gap," aiming for targets identified based on price action.
* **Secret Tip:**  For increased profitability, look for a break of structure *after* the initial market structure shift, before the final entry. This creates an "inverse turtle soup" pattern.
* **Timeframe:** The examples use 15-minute and 1-minute/2-minute timeframes.
* **Course Promotion:** The presenter promotes a course update ($97) with additional content and a new trading strategy.  However, he emphasizes that the YouTube content alone is sufficient for learning the strategy.


The video provides two examples illustrating the strategy's application.  The presenter claims that consistent application of these rules can lead to profitability within 30-90 days, depending on the trader's experience level.  The meaning of "Kill Zone R's" is not explicitly defined.
