This video teaches a trading strategy using liquidity levels identified within fair value gaps (or, alternatively, volume imbalances).

**Core Concept:**  Valid liquidity highs and lows are formed *inside* fair value gaps.  Price is anticipated to retrace to these levels.

**Identifying Valid Liquidity:**

* **Fair Value Gaps:**  Highs and lows formed within a fair value gap are considered valid liquidity levels.  If a high (or low) breaches the first candle of the gap, it's not considered valid.
* **Volume Imbalances:**  Can be used as an alternative to fair value gaps, but fair value gaps are deemed more accurate.

**Trading Strategy:**

1. **Identify:** Find a high and low within a fair value gap on a higher timeframe (daily, weekly).
2. **Breakout:** Wait for price to break out above the high or below the low.
3. **Timeframe Shift:** Switch to a lower timeframe (e.g., 1-hour for daily, 4-hour for weekly).
4. **Market Structure Shift:** Look for a market structure shift confirming the breakout (e.g., a higher high/lower low depending on the direction of the breakout).
5. **Entry:** Enter a trade in the direction of the breakout after the market structure shift is confirmed.
6. **Target:** Target the opposing liquidity level (the low if the breakout was above the high, and vice versa).  Consider a closer target to mitigate risk.

**Timeframe Considerations:**

* **Daily timeframe:**  Drop down to the 1-hour timeframe for confirmation.
* **Weekly timeframe:** Drop down to the 4-hour timeframe for confirmation.
* **4-hour timeframe:** Drop down to the 15-minute timeframe for confirmation.

**Important Notes:**

* Once a high or low within a fair value gap is broken, that gap is no longer relevant for identifying further liquidity.
* The strategy uses the identified liquidity levels as targets, but price action may not always reach them perfectly.
* Risk management is crucial; use stop-loss orders.

The video provides numerous chart examples to illustrate the strategy.
