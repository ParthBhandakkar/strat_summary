This video describes an AR50 trading strategy, claiming high profitability but acknowledging periods of losses.  Key aspects include:

**Strategy Overview:**  The AR50 strategy uses daily and weekly bias to identify trading opportunities.  Profit targets are 1-2 or 1-3 risk-reward ratios (RR).  The presenter emphasizes that while highly profitable in the long run (potentially 30 RR in a good month), losing weeks and months are normal.

**Bias Identification (Multiple Methods):**

* **Method 1 (Power of Three):**  This involves identifying weekly candle expansion direction using:
    * Weekly timeframe: Mark weekly candle opening price (5 PM New York time), observe market structure shifts, and utilize Fibonacci retracements from the last low to the last high before the shift.  Look for another shift above -2 standard deviation projections. This identifies accumulation, manipulation, and distribution phases.
    * 15-minute timeframe: After identifying the weekly opening price, look for a market structure shift below (or above) the opening price.  Further shifts above -2, -2.5, or -4 standard deviations indicate price continuing upward.  Avoid setups reaching -4.
    * Daily timeframe: Repeat the process daily, identifying daily power of three patterns.

* **Method 2 (Liquidity):** This involves identifying weekly and daily direction based on liquidity:
    * Weekly timeframe: Look for price to take out external range liquidity (highs and lows) on the weekly timeframe.  Then, drop to the 4-hour timeframe to find a market structure shift which confirms bias.  Mark the Point of Decision Range (PDRA) on the 4-hour chart and drop to the 15-minute timeframe looking for another market structure shift within the PDRA to confirm entries.
    * Daily timeframe: Similar process on the daily timeframe identifying external and internal range liquidity.  Drop to the 1-hour timeframe after a high is taken out to confirm the bias.  Then drop to the 5-minute timeframe for entry confirmation.

**Trade Entry:**

* **Asian Session Method:**  Mark the Asian session high and low (8 PM â€“ 2 AM New York time). If bearish, enter short positions from the 0.5 level of the Asian range once the price closes below the Asian low.  If bullish, enter long positions from the 0.5 level of the Asian range once the price closes above the Asian high.

**High Time Frame Autoflow:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of quickly identifying the market direction (within 5 seconds) to confirm high time frame autoflow; if uncertain, move to a different asset.


**Indicators Used:**  FXN (for Asian session range) and fractals by Rachel.


**Disclaimer:** The presenter acknowledges potential losses and recommends leaving if the prospect of losing weeks or months is unacceptable.  They offer a paid course for more detailed instruction.
