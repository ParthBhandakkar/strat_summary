Ajit's 9:30 AM Judas Swing Trading Strategy:

**Core Strategy:**

* **Timeframes:** Primarily uses 15-minute and 1-minute charts.  Also mentions 2-minute and 4-hour charts for additional context and confirmation.
* **Time:** The strategy focuses on the period between 9:30 AM and 9:45 AM for indices (8:30 AM and 8:45 AM for Forex).
* **Initial Setup (15-minute chart):** Identify the most recent swing high and swing low before 9:30 AM.
* **Key Condition:** Between 9:30 AM and 9:45 AM, the 15-minute candle must take out *either* the swing high or swing low.
* **Entry (1-minute chart):**  After the high or low is taken out, look for a liquidity sweep (often shown by a market structure shift, break of structure, or Fair Value Gap (FVG)) on the 1-minute chart *before* 9:45 AM.  Enter the trade based on this liquidity sweep, targeting 1-2 R (Risk Reward).
* **Invalidation:** If the price does not take out the high or low before 9:45 AM, the setup is invalid.  If the high is taken out after 9:45 AM, the trade is also invalid.

**Advanced Techniques for Increased Win Rate:**

* **4-hour Chart Analysis:** Identify the dealing range (high and low) on the 4-hour chart to determine the overall trend (bullish or bearish).  If bearish and in a discount zone, prioritize setups where the high is taken out. If bullish, prioritize the low being taken out.
* **Double Sweep (Crucial):** Before 9:29 AM (indices), ideally both the high and low should be swept. The algorithm will use both buy-side and sell-side liquidity.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Works best with Indices:** The strategy is optimized for indices (9:30 AM open). Forex traders should adapt it to their market's open (8:30 AM).
* **Setup Frequency:** Setups don't appear every day, but several per week are expected.
* **Patience:** Requires patience to identify the correct setups.
