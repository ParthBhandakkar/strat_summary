This video offers tips for traders aiming to earn $100,000 in 2024.  The speaker emphasizes that while making millions is possible, it's unrealistic for beginners.  The key tips include:

1. **Lose bad friends:**  Limit socializing with friends who encourage unproductive behaviors (drinking, smoking weed daily).  Dedicate one day a week for socializing.

2. **Backtest more than you trade:**  Spend significantly more time backtesting (3-4 hours daily) than live trading.  Only trade setups identified during backtesting.  Backtest for at least one year to build discipline and improve trading psychology.  A profitable trading model is crucial before focusing heavily on psychology and risk management.

3. **Daily meditation and journaling:** Start with 10 seconds of daily meditation, gradually increasing the duration.  Journal daily about things you're grateful for to maintain positivity.

4. **Find a model and stick to it:** Aim for a consistent, sustainable win rate (e.g., 43-44% with a 1:2 risk/reward ratio).  Avoid chasing unrealistic win rates.

5. **Unfollow most trading gurus:** Follow only one or two gurus to avoid conflicting advice.  Real trading success requires personal experience and practice.

6. **Journal your trades:**  Record details of winning trades (time, entry method, asset, etc.) to improve your model over time.

7. **Spend time with family:** Improve mood and reduce stress through family connections.

8. **Make new trading friends:**  Connect with other traders (e.g., via Twitter) to collaborate and learn from each other.
