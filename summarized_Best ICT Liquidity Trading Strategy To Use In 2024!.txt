This video teaches how to find daily bias, draw on liquidity, and valid liquidity levels using fair value gaps.  The core method involves identifying the highest/lowest points (liquidity points) within a fair value gap on a given timeframe (e.g., daily chart for daily bias, 4-hour chart for intraday bias).

**Key Steps:**

1. **Identify Fair Value Gap:** Locate a fair value gap on the chosen timeframe.
2. **Find Highs and Lows:** Identify the most recent high and low formed *within* the fair value gap.  Only one high and one low are considered valid within a single fair value gap.  If price sweeps a high/low, it's no longer a valid liquidity point.
3. **Price Action:** Wait for price to break either the high or the low within the fair value gap.
4. **Confirm with Market Structure Shift:** Drop down to a lower timeframe (e.g., 15-minute chart from a daily chart, 5-minute chart from a 1-hour chart). Look for a market structure shift (consecutive candles indicating a trend change) to confirm the break.
5. **Target:** The target is the opposite extreme (high or low) within the fair value gap.  If price breaks the low, the target is the high; if price breaks the high, the target is the low.

**Example:** On a daily chart, if price breaks the high within a fair value gap, switch to a 1-hour chart.  A market structure shift confirms the move, and the target becomes the low within the fair value gap on the daily chart.

The method is presented as applicable across multiple timeframes, and the speaker emphasizes that these liquidity levels are stronger than others.  The video includes multiple examples to illustrate the technique.
