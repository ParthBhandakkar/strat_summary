This YouTube video teaches a trading strategy called "Power of 3," focusing on identifying market bias and taking advantage of price movements.  The core concepts are:

**Identifying Bias:**

* **Three-Candle Pattern:** Uses two candles to determine the bias for the third.  If the second candle closes above the first candle's high, the bias is bullish; if below the first candle's low, it's bearish.
* **Timeframes:** Uses weekly and daily timeframes to determine bias. Weekly is for larger, higher-risk trades; daily is for smaller, more consistent trades.

**Trading the Power of 3:**

* **Weekly Timeframe:**
    * Identify the opening price of the third candle.
    * Drop down to the 4-hour timeframe.
    * Look for a "sweep" of sell-side (bullish bias) or buy-side (bearish bias) liquidity to the left of the opening price.
    * Go to the 15-minute timeframe to find a market structure shift for entry.

* **Daily Timeframe:**
    * Similar process as weekly, but uses the 1-hour timeframe for liquidity identification and the 5-minute timeframe for entry.
    * Avoid "farics" (presumably referring to specific chart patterns) on the daily timeframe.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Risk-Reward:** The strategy aims for high risk-reward trades (1:5 or even 1:10).
* **Practice:**  The instructor emphasizes the importance of 60 days of practice to master the strategy.
* **Bias is Crucial:**  The instructor stresses the importance of identifying bias to avoid being "faked out" by manipulation moves.
* **Market Structure:** Entry is confirmed by a market structure shift on lower timeframes.

The video includes multiple examples illustrating how to apply the strategy to different currency pairs (e.g., USDCAD) on both weekly and daily timeframes.  The instructor also promotes a paid crypto signal service.
