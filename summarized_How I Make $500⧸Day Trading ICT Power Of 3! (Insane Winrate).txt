This video describes a forex trading strategy called "ACT Power of 3" for scalping on the 1-minute timeframe, aiming for ~$500 daily profit.  The core concept involves:

**Identifying Intraday Bias:** Using two consecutive 1-hour candles:

* **Bullish Bias:** The second candle closes above the high of the first.
* **Bearish Bias:** The second candle closes below the high of the first (even if it wicks above).

**Taking Entries (1-minute chart):**

* On the opening of the third 1-hour candle, switch to the 1-minute chart.
* **Bearish Bias:** Look for price to move up, take out liquidity (resistance levels) to the left of the opening price, and then create a market structure shift (a clear reversal signal). Enter a short position targeting previous lows.
* **Bullish Bias:** Look for price to move down, take out liquidity (support levels) to the left of the opening price, and then create a market structure shift. Enter a long position targeting previous highs.

**Key elements:**

* **Liquidity:** Identifying and trading around prior highs and lows (liquidity pools).
* **Market Structure Shift:** A clear reversal signal on the 1-minute chart confirming the entry.
* **Wicks:**  Sufficient for entry signals; body closures are not strictly necessary.
* **Power of 3:** The strategy utilizes the price action of three consecutive 1-hour candles (two to determine bias, one for entry).

The presenter claims an 80-85% win rate using this strategy (though this is anecdotal and not verified).  He will be live trading this strategy in his Discord server starting in January.
