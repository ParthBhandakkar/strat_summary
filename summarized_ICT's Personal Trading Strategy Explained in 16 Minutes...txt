This video explains ICT's market maker model, a trading strategy detailed in his latest one-hour YouTube lecture.  The model uses three timeframes (e.g., daily, hourly, 5-minute).

**Steps:**

1. **Identify Market Direction (Highest Timeframe):** Determine if the market is bullish or bearish using autoflow (overall trend) on the highest timeframe.

2. **Identify Liquidity (Highest Timeframe):**  Locate buy-side liquidity (relative equal highs or swing highs) if bearish, or sell-side liquidity if bullish.

3. **Identify Fray Valley Gap/PDR (Highest Timeframe):** Find a fray valley gap (or potential downside reversal â€“ PDR) above the identified liquidity.  The presenter prefers fray valley gaps.

4. **Identify Last Low (Highest Timeframe):** Once price enters the fray valley gap, identify the last low formed on the highest timeframe.

5. **Market Maker Model Identification (Lower Timeframes):** Drop down to a lower timeframe (e.g., hourly). Look for:
    * **Original Consolidation:** A period where price struggles to break above or below a range.
    * **Consolidation Breakout Trade:** Enter on the retest of the consolidation's breakout.
    * **Accumulation Phases (Optional):** Enter during accumulation phase one or two (before the fray valley gap is hit).  The presenter doesn't prefer this entry.
    * **Market Structure Shift:** Look for a market structure shift (e.g., break of structure, consecutive bearish candles) to confirm price movement.

6. **Lower Timeframe Entries (Optional):** Optionally, go to an even lower timeframe (e.g., 5-minute) to look for additional confirmation (e.g., a second market structure shift).  The presenter says this isn't necessary.

7. **Optimal Entry:** The best entry is usually on the second distribution leg (a break of structure after the initial price movement into the fray valley gap).

**Key Concepts:**

* **Autoflow:** The overall trend of the market.
* **Liquidity:** Areas where significant buying or selling pressure exists.
* **Fray Valley Gap/PDR:** Gaps or price action indicating potential turning points.
* **Original Consolidation:** A period of sideways price action.
* **Market Structure Shift:** A change in the overall price trend, confirmed by candlestick patterns.
* **Time is Fractal:** The same patterns and principles apply across multiple timeframes.

The video includes two examples (NZDJPY and another unspecified pair) illustrating the strategy.  The presenter notes that trades won't always be perfect.  The video concludes with a promotion for the presenter's trading course.
