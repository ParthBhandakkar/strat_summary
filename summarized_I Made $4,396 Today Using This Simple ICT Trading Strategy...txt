This text describes a forex trading strategy and promotes a trading course and a forex funding provider.  Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Trading Strategy:**

* **Core Principle:**  The strategy revolves around identifying and trading from "internal range liquidity" (fair-value gaps) to "external range liquidity" (highs and lows).
* **Time Frame Approach:** The trader uses multiple time frames:
    * **Daily:** Identifies the internal range liquidity (fair-value gap or "Ferrari gap").
    * **1-hour:** Looks for a market structure shift (lower low, lower high, lower low formation) confirming the daily gap's validity.  A "bicep liquidity purge" is also a desirable confirmation.
    * **5-minute:**  After the 1-hour confirmation, the trader looks for another market structure shift and enters the trade from a 5-minute "Ferrari gap" or "auto-blog" within the premium level.
* **Entry and Exit:** Entry is taken after multiple confirmations across timeframes.  The exit targets a pre-determined risk/reward ratio (1:2), often aligning with significant price levels like the extreme target (a relevant equal low).

**Trading Course:**

* **Offered through a private Discord server:** Provides signals, market analysis, weekly Q&A, market forecasts, and strategies.
* **Curriculum:**  Covers ICT basics (Ferrari gaps, auto-blogs, liquidity), no-daily-bar strategies, ICT essentials (SMT divergences, breaker blogs, volume and balances, entry patterns, Asian session strategies), and advanced strategies (market maker models, risk management, silver bullet strategies).
* **Cost:**  The author claims it is a more affordable alternative to expensive trading gurus.

**Forex Funding Provider Promotion:**

* **Company:** Blue Guardian is heavily promoted as a reliable and high-quality forex funding provider.
* **Benefits:** 85% profit split, low spreads, positive reviews, rapid evaluation program (only phase one needed for funding).
* **Discount Code:** "fast-smc" for a 10% discount.
