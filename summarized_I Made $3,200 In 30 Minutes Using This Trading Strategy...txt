This video describes a forex trading strategy that allegedly generated over $3000 profit for the presenter.  The core strategy involves:

**1. Daily Timeframe Identification:**
* Identify the daily candle's high and low.
* Wait for price to break either the daily high or daily low.

**2. One-Hour Timeframe Analysis:**
* Switch to the one-hour timeframe.
* Use Fibonacci retracement from the daily range high to low (or low to high, depending on the breakout).
* Identify a "fairly gap" (presumably a significant gap in price action) above or below the 50% Fibonacci level. This gap represents the target for the trade.  Prioritize fairly gaps below 50% if both above and below exist.

**3. Five-Minute/Fifteen-Minute Timeframe Entry:**
* Switch to the five-minute (or fifteen-minute) timeframe.
* Look for a market structure shift (e.g., a broken low or high).
* Enter the trade *after 2 AM New York time* at the identified "fairly gap" or near an auto-block (not fully explained).

**4. Risk/Reward:**
* The stop loss is placed above/below the entry point, aiming for a 1:2 or better risk-reward ratio.

**Additional Considerations:**
* The presenter suggests using SMT divergence to increase probability.
* Wicks can be considered for market structure shifts.


The video includes multiple examples of the strategy applied to different currency pairs.  The presenter strongly emphasizes sticking to this strategy and promotes their Discord server and a paid service for passing prop firm challenges.
