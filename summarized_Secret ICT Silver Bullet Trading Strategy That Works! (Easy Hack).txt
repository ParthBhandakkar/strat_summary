This video describes a trading strategy called the "ICT silver bullet hack" for trading the London and New York sessions (but not the PM session) of specific currency pairs and indices.  The core strategy involves identifying the first "freeway gap" after 3 AM and 10 AM New York time.

**Key Rules:**

* **Trading Times:** Only trade the London and New York "silver bullet" sessions (3-4 AM and 10-11 AM New York time).
* **Freeway Gap:** Identify the *first* freeway gap formed after the session begins.  This gap is identified using an indicator called "ICT silver bullet" by MLK1903.
* **BPR (Balanced Price Range):** The first freeway gap *must* also have a BPR (old, unrespected gap) aligned with it.  A bearish freeway gap requires a bearish BPR; a bullish freeway gap requires a bullish BPR.  The BPR is identified using an indicator called "BPR" by tradeforup.
* **Entry and Exit:** Enter the trade at the freeway gap, place a stop loss at the high (for short trades) or low (for long trades) of the candle containing the gap, and target a 1:2 risk-reward ratio (or break even at 1:1).
* **Recommended Pairs:** GBPUSD, NAS100, and SP500.  The strategy is claimed to *not* work with other pairs.
* **Timeframe:** Use a 5-minute chart.

**Indicators:**

* **ICT silver bullet (by MLK1903):** Identifies the first freeway gap.  Dark blue indicates bearish, yellow indicates bullish.
* **BPR (by tradeforup):** Identifies the balanced price range. Red indicates bearish, green indicates bullish.

The presenter offers a paid course ($97) for more detailed explanations and signals.  He also claims to have backtested and forward-tested the strategy.  While he suggests looking for additional confluences (like liquidity), he emphasizes the core strategy's simplicity.
