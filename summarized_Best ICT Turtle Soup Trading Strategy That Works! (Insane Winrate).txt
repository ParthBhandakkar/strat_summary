This video teaches a trading strategy for predicting London and New York session price movements with 80% accuracy.  The strategy, which the creator claims is unique, uses the Asian session range (8 PM - 2 AM New York time) as a key indicator.

**Core Strategy:**

1. **Identify Asian Range:** Mark the high and low of the Asian session (using the 2 AM New York time candle close to define the range's end).
2. **Determine Bias:**
    * If the Asian session low breaks *first*, the bias is bearish.  Then, wait for the Asian high to break.
    * If the Asian session high breaks *first*, the bias is bullish. Then, wait for the Asian low to break.
3. **Entry:** After establishing the bias (both high and low broken), look for:
    * **Market Structure Shift:** A clear shift in market structure on the 15-minute timeframe after price returns to the Asian range. Enter a trade in the direction of the established bias.
    * **Double Sweep:** If no clear market structure shift occurs, wait for price to sweep the broken Asian range low (or high) twice. Enter a trade on the retest of the range after the second sweep.
4. **Target:**  The target is the previous swing high (for short trades) or swing low (for long trades) from before the Asian session breakouts.

**Timeframe:** The entire strategy is based on the 15-minute timeframe.

**Recommended Assets:** The strategy is best suited for indices (like NASDAQ 100, US 30, S&P 500), but it can also be used on forex and gold.

**Indicator:** The creator uses an indicator called "FXN Asian Session Range" (labels and lines disabled).
