This YouTube video describes a trading technique called SMT (Simultaneous Market Trend) divergence to improve win rates in forex and stock trading.  The core concept is identifying discrepancies in price action between correlated asset pairs.

**SMT Divergence:**  SMT divergence occurs when one asset breaks through a key resistance level (External Range Liquidity, ERL) while a correlated asset fails to do so.  This suggests a potential reversal in the failing asset.

**Confirmation:** The divergence isn't confirmed until a market structure shift (MSS) is observed on a lower timeframe.  This usually involves identifying a market sugar shift on a one-hour chart *before* the second asset breaks its resistance.  A five-minute chart can provide further confirmation with another MSS.

**Two Methods for Identifying SMT Divergence:**

1. **Daily Timeframe:** Look for SMT on the daily chart. If confirmed with a one-hour MSS, enter the trade directly from the one-hour Point of Data Reversal Area (PDRA).
2. **One-Hour Timeframe:** If no daily SMT is found, look for SMT on the one-hour chart. Confirm it with a five-minute MSS before entering a trade.

**Entry and Target:** Entries are typically taken from inefficiencies like gaps or auto-blocks within the PDRA identified on the relevant timeframe (one-hour or five-minute, depending on the method used). Targets are set based on the identified liquidity levels (internal range liquidity on the daily chart, for example).

**Examples:** The video provides examples using currency pairs (e.g., EURUSD, GU) and stock indices (e.g., NAS 100, US 30) to illustrate how to identify and trade SMT divergences.  Specific examples show how the technique works on both the daily and one-hour timeframes.

**Additional Notes:**

* The video emphasizes the importance of time frame alignment (daily, hourly, five-minute).
* The speaker mentions using ERL and internal range liquidity as key price levels.
* The speaker promotes their own trading course, FAS SMT 2.0, offering more detailed instruction.
