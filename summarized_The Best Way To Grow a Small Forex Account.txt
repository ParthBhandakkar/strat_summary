This video provides a guide on growing a small Forex account.  The key steps are:

**1. Finding a Profitable Strategy:**

*   Backtest a trading system at least 100 times to identify a profitable "edge."  Free strategies are available on the YouTuber's channel.

**2. Demo Account Practice:**

*   Trade on a demo account for at least two weeks to gain experience and familiarize yourself with market dynamics (candlestick patterns, consolidation vs. trending markets).

**3. Live Trading (Small Account):**

*   Start with a small account ($100-$1000).
*   **Risk Management:** Risk 10% per trade initially.  Aim for 1:2 or 1:3 risk-reward ratios (e.g., risk $10 to potentially earn $20-$30).
*   **Trade Selection:**
    *   Trade during key market hours (avoid high spreads outside these times).
    *   Avoid trading when the market is consolidating.
    *   Trade on days with high-impact news (wait 10 minutes after news release).
    *   Trade when there's a clear trend on higher timeframes (e.g., daily chart).
    *   Take only your best setups ("A+" trades).
*   **Trade Frequency:**  Maximum two trades per day.  Avoid revenge trading. If you win a trade, consider resting for the day.
*   **Time Frame:** Stick to the 15-minute time frame.
*   **Account Growth:** Gradually decrease risk percentage (from 10% to 5%) as your account grows to $600-$700.

**4. Mindset:**

*   Treat Forex trading like a video game, progressing through levels.
*   Remain emotionless and avoid overtrading.
*   Only use money you can afford to lose.


The YouTuber emphasizes that this process requires effort and patience; there are no shortcuts.
