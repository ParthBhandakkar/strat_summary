The video describes an ICT trading pattern called the "three drives pattern."  This pattern is used to identify short or long entry points in a bearish or bullish trend, respectively.

**The Pattern:**

* **Higher Time Frame (e.g., 4-hour):** Identify a Point of Interest (POI) within a bearish or bullish autoflow.
* **Lower Time Frame (e.g., 15-minute):** Look for three consecutive drives (higher highs) before price reaches the POI.  Each drive is followed by a pullback.  The third drive should either reach or significantly approach the POI.  Two "decryptus sweeps" (liquidity sweeps) are often observed within the three drives.

**Entry Strategy (credited to Trade X on YouTube):**

1. **Identify the highest closing candle of the *second* drive.**
2. **Wait for price to close below that candle.**
3. **Enter a trade on the retest of that candle's low.**

**Target:**  One to three times the distance of the initial trade setup, targeting previously identified lows or liquidity levels.

**The video emphasizes:**

* Clean market structure is crucial for reliable pattern identification.
* The strategy is used in conjunction with identifying autoflows and POIs on a higher timeframe, then confirming the pattern on a lower timeframe.
* The strategy is considered high-win-rate when used correctly.
