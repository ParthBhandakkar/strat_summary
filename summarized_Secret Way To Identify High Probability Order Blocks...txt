This video explains how to identify a valid "auto block" in trading, specifically within the context of SMC (likely a trading methodology) and ICT (Inner Circle Trader) principles.  The key points are:

**What an Invalid Auto Block is:**  Many traders incorrectly identify the last bullish (or bearish) candle in a break of structure as an auto block. This often leads to stop-outs.

**What a Valid Auto Block is:** A valid auto block requires a **liquidity sweep** before a break of structure.  It's not a single candle, but a series of consecutive bullish (or bearish) candles that take out a liquidity level.  This liquidity sweep is often identified as a lower low/lower high (or higher high/higher low) followed by a price push that breaks the structure. The auto block is the consecutive candles that complete this liquidity sweep.

**Identifying the Auto Block:**

* **Liquidity Sweep:**  A crucial element.  The price must take out a previously established liquidity level (often identified visually on a chart).
* **Market Structure Shift:** The liquidity sweep must be followed by a clear shift in market structure (e.g., a higher high after a lower low sequence).
* **Consecutive Candles:** The auto block consists of the consecutive candles that complete the liquidity sweep.  It's not just the last candle.
* **Entry Point:** The entry should ideally be taken from the body of the second or last candle of the auto block, or even from the first candle of a fair value gap identified on a lower timeframe. Avoid entering at the wick.
* **Time Frame:** High-timeframe auto flow is a plus point, and entries are best placed during London or New York sessions.  Liquidity sweeps above the 0.5 Fibonacci level are preferred.
* **Open and Close:** Only consider the open and close of the candles when identifying the auto block, not the highs and lows.

**Example Scenarios:** The video provides several chart examples to illustrate valid and invalid auto block identification, emphasizing the importance of liquidity sweeps and market structure shifts.  Incorrect identification usually involves focusing on a single candle instead of the sequence taking out liquidity.
