This video by Fez explains how to identify high-probability market structure shifts, differentiating them from liquidity sweeps.  Key concepts include:

**Identifying Liquidity Sweeps:**

* **Step 1: Check the Trend:**  A move against the overall trend is more likely a market structure shift, while a move *with* the trend is more likely a liquidity sweep.

**Identifying Market Structure Shifts:**

* **Higher Timeframe Analysis:** Examine higher timeframes (e.g., daily if trading on a 4-hour chart) to identify significant highs and lows.  A break of these significant highs/lows on the higher timeframe often precedes a market structure shift on lower timeframes.
* **Break of Structure After Liquidity Sweep:** A market structure shift is often preceded by a liquidity sweep on a higher timeframe followed by a break of the resulting structure on a lower timeframe.  This is identified by price taking out a significant high or low on the higher timeframe.
* **Failed Fair Value Gap:**  A higher high/low that fails to fill a fair value gap, followed by a break of that structure on a lower timeframe, signals a high-probability market structure shift.
* **Alternative Method (using Fair Value Gaps):** After a liquidity sweep, if price creates a fair value gap during a bullish/bearish reaction, fails to fill that gap, and then breaks the structure, this can also indicate a market structure shift. This method does not require the breaking of pre-existing highs or lows.


**High-Probability Market Structure Shift Identification:**

The video emphasizes that high-probability shifts often involve:

* A liquidity sweep on a higher timeframe.
* A break of structure (often after a failed fair value gap) on a lower timeframe.

The video provides examples illustrating these concepts, emphasizing the use of fair value gaps and how to identify entry and exit points based on these patterns.  Fez also mentions his own trading strategies and a paid course for further learning.
