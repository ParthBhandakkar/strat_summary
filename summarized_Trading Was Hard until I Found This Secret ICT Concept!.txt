This video teaches a trading technique called SMT divergence, focusing on identifying and exploiting divergences between correlated currency pairs and assets (e.g., USD/GBP, AUD/USD, NZD/USD, GBP/JPY, EUR/JPY, AUD/JPY, NZD/JPY; assets: NAS 100, USD, S&P 500).

**The core process:**

1. **Identify Correlated Pairs:** Choose correlated pairs from the list provided.

2. **Mark Session Highs and Lows:** Mark the high and low of either the Asian or London session on your chosen pairs using a 15-minute timeframe.  An indicator called "FXN Asian session range" is suggested to define these sessions.

3. **SMT Divergence:** Look for SMT divergence. This occurs when one pair breaks the session high or low (sweeps liquidity), while the other fails to do so.

4. **Change in State of Delivery:** Confirm the SMT divergence with a "change in the state of delivery." This is achieved when the price closes above (for a long trade) or below (for a short trade) the body of the candle that caused the SMT divergence on the pair that *didn't* sweep the liquidity.  A market structure shift or break of structure can also confirm the setup.

5. **Entry and Target:**  Enter the trade on the confirmed change in state of delivery (or retest). The target is the session high (long) or low (short) of the pair that *didn't* sweep the liquidity.

6. **Session Selection:** If the setup isn't present in the Asian session, move to the London session and repeat the process.


**Example:** If GBP/USD breaks the Asian session low but EUR/USD does not, and EUR/USD subsequently closes above the body of the candle that formed the Asian low on GBP/USD, a long position is taken on EUR/USD, targeting the Asian session high.


The presenter emphasizes the mechanical nature of the technique and its applicability across various assets, though adding daily bias can improve win rate.  Multiple examples are shown using NAS 100 and US 30.
