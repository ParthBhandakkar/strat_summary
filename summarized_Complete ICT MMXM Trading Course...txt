This course teaches how to identify and trade using market maker models.  The instructor claims 6-7 years of trading experience and successful student funding.  The core concept revolves around identifying market shifts and using multiple timeframes (e.g., 4-hour, 15-minute, 1-minute) to pinpoint high-probability entry and exit points.

**Key elements of the Market Maker Model:**

* **Original Consolidation:**  The initial price consolidation period.
* **Consolidation Phase(s) 2 & 3:** Subsequent consolidation periods or pullbacks.  At least one is required after the original consolidation.
* **PDRA (Point of Dominant Range Area):** Significant highs and lows identified on higher timeframes (e.g., 4-hour, daily).
* **Market Structure Shift:** A clear change in the market trend, identified on lower timeframes.  This often involves patterns like "lower low, lower high, lower low" or "higher high, higher low, higher high."
* **Smart Money Reversal:**  The point where the market reverses.
* **Entry Patterns:**  The course details multiple entry methods, including low-risk entries (0.5% risk) targeting the original consolidation high.  Entries are often taken after liquidity sweeps.  The instructor uses a ABCD pattern or low low low high low low sweep to identify liquidity and then looks for a market structure shift on a lower timeframe.
* **Mitigation Blocks:**  Bullish or bearish auto-blocks formed during price movements toward the PDRA, which can be used to identify potential entry points.
* **Timeframe Analysis:** The instructor emphasizes using multiple timeframes to confirm setups, starting with a higher timeframe PDRA and moving down to lower timeframes for entry confirmation.
* **ERL (External Range Liquidity) and IORL (Internal Range Liquidity):** ERL refers to high or low points, while IORL refers to fair value gaps within a trading range. The price action often moves between ERL and IORL.  IORLs on higher timeframes often represent original consolidations on lower timeframes.


**Instructor's Personal Approach:**

The instructor shares two personal approaches:

1. **ERL to IORL Method:** Uses higher timeframe ERL breakouts to identify IORLs on lower timeframes, looking for market structure shifts and ABCD patterns before entry.
2. **PDRA-Based Method:**  Uses higher timeframe PDRAs to identify original consolidations and subsequent market structure shifts on lower timeframes.  This method involves two or three timeframes.


The course includes numerous charts as examples to illustrate these concepts.  The instructor emphasizes that while the market maker model provides a framework, not every trade will be a winner and proper risk management is crucial.
