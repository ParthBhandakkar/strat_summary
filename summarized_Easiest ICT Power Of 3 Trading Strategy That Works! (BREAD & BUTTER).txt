This YouTube video describes a forex trading strategy claimed to be consistently profitable.  The key elements are:

**Strategy:**

1. **Economic Calendar Focus:** Trade only on high-impact news days (primarily Tuesdays or Wednesdays), ideally after the news event concludes.

2. **Weekly Open Price Identification:** Identify the opening price of the new weekly candle on the weekly timeframe.

3. **Four-Hour Timeframe Analysis:**  On the four-hour chart, locate the previous week's highs and lows (to the left of the weekly opening price identified in step 2). These represent liquidity pools.

4. **Manipulation Identification:** Look for a "purge" (a significant price movement) at these previous highs or lows on the high-impact news day.  The goal is to identify a manipulation of price around these liquidity zones.

5. **15-Minute Timeframe Entry:** After the four-hour purge, switch to the 15-minute chart. Look for a market structure shift (e.g., higher high/higher low or lower low/lower high) confirming the direction of the manipulation.

6. **Entry & Exit:** Enter the trade during the London or New York session, targeting the nearest liquidity pool (1:2 or 1:3 risk/reward ratio).  If an entry isn't found the same day, look for a "continuation purge" on the following day and re-evaluate for a market structure shift.

**Assets:** The strategy is best suited for EURUSD, NAS100, GBPUSD, or Gold (but EURUSD, NAS100, and S&P 500 are specifically recommended).

**Backtesting Results:** The creator claims a 63% win rate and a 2:1 risk/reward ratio over 50 trades from January to August 2024 across two currency pairs and one asset, resulting in ~$48,000 profit on a $100,000 account (or approximately $48,000 profit on a $300,000 account due to trading multiple assets).

**Disclaimer:** The video strongly emphasizes that this strategy is not guaranteed to be profitable and encourages viewers to dislike the video if it doesn't work for them.  A paid mentorship program is also advertised.
