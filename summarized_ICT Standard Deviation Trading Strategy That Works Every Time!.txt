This video teaches a trading strategy using standard deviation and Fibonacci tools to determine take-profit levels.  The core concepts are:

**1. Identifying Key Levels:**  The strategy begins by identifying a "key level" (e.g., point of interest, extended liquidity, PDA area, order block) where price action significantly reverses.

**2. Market Structure Shift:** After price reaches the key level, a "shift in market structure" is required to confirm the trade setup.

**3. Fibonacci Tool Application:** A Fibonacci tool is applied from the swing high to the swing low (or vice versa depending on the trend) preceding the key level.

**4. Standard Deviation Take Profit:** The negative two (-2) level on the Fibonacci tool is crucial.  Any liquidity level below -2 becomes the take-profit target.  Alternatively, the trader can exit at the -2 level itself, but liquidity below -2 is preferred.  The -4 level is mentioned as a potential area for price rejection.

**5. Time Frame Strategy:** The strategy uses two timeframes: a higher timeframe (e.g., weekly/daily) to identify the key level and external liquidity, and a lower timeframe (e.g., 4-hour/1-hour) to identify the market structure shift and entry point.  The suggested timeframe pairs are:

* Swing trader: Weekly and 4-hour
* Day trader: Daily and 1-hour
* Scalper: 4-hour and 15-minute (minimum)

**6. Liquidity Consideration:** The existence of liquidity (internal or external) below the -2 level is essential for the trade setup. If no liquidity exists below -2, the trade should be avoided.  Internal liquidity, if hit before the -2 level, may alter the take-profit target.

**7. Entry & Confirmation:** Entry is taken after the market structure shift on the lower timeframe.

**8. Alternative Take Profit:** If a high or low exists below the -2 level but above the initial liquidity target, that high/low becomes the new take-profit level.

The video includes several examples using USD/CAD and AUD/CAD pairs to illustrate the strategy's application and also promotes a paid mentorship program.
